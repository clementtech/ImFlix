## Road Map:
- [ ] When Not in IMDB site, clicking on the extension will navigate to IMDB site to browse for Movie
- [ ] On IMDB site, when you search on a movie, clicking on the extension will open the video player to allow the user to enjoy the movie

### This project is intended for practicing and experimenting with connecting my code to multiple APIs. Please use it at your own risk, and always ensure you respect copyright laws.
